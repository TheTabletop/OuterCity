## README for Front End 

For iteration 1 we hit our goal of getting down as much of the HTML and CSS we could 
for the 11 views and 4 subviews that our design wishes to implement.  In this directory,
we have static versions layouts for out Inbox, Player and Group Profile pages,
the Search Screen, minor views like About Us and Contact Us, Login, and our Two-Stage Password recovery.  
The directory also contains a stylesheet for universally used CSS styles, and a dynamic navigation
bar that will be integrated into the majority of our pages (see Desgin Document for which in specific).  

As far as running the code, it probably is exceedingly obvious that all one need do is open the html
page and one will be able to see our static (and in a few cases like our navbar, dynamic) views, such 
as they are.  

We waited to implement some of our more dynamic views that require a Angular and a functioning backend
like the filters and message pop up (we want those to be animated pop-up screens), the Group Wall (filled
with backend data), and the Edit pages (which rely on Angular to alter the data pulled from the DB).
