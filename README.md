## README for Front End 

For Iteration 2, we integrated AngularJs into our project.  This included creating 
 controllers for each html page(and others where we deemed necessary), routing our
 pages, integrating the API, and making our once static pages dynamic.  Other quality of 
 life improvements were made, such as nailing down a consistent style, turning 
  the NavBar into a partial view, altering the project hierarchy for more orginized development,
  and making slight design altercations to the HTML.  
  However, since our API was not hosted by the time we had to turn in Iteration 2,
  we were not able to integrate our custom API into our pages.  This meant primarily 
  two things;  that we could really only test our routing (which we did via Protractor)
  and we were not able to write gets and posts or check responses from our own API.  
  Thus, in order to showcase what we think our pages will look like once populated 
  with real data, we have API code written that interacts with a different API.  Once we 
  have our API hosted, it will be as easy as substituting one http for another.
